        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A delicious baked ham recipe that my family loves. Sweetly seasoned ham roasted with moist heat is a delicious way to celebrate special occasions. 
            If using a pre-cooked ham, follow the directions on the package for baking times.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li>1 (12 pound) bone-in ham, rump portion</li>
            <li>Â½ cup whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="recipe-steps">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Place ham in a large roasting pan; press cloves into the top at 1- to 2-inch intervals. Pack the top with a layer of brown sugar. Pour enough water 
                into the bottom of the roasting pan to come to a 1-inch depth; cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, or until the internal temperature of the ham has reached 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), making sure 
                the meat thermometer is not touching the bone. Let stand for about 20 minutes before carving.
            </li>
        </ol>
